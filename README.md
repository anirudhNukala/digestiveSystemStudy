# digestiveSystemStudy
During our final project for our Senior Year AP Biology class, my friends and I created a study tool for the Digestive System.
I created the template for the website while my partners wrote out the definitions and picked out the images that we would use
I coded this using HTML/CSS and used PHP as the back-end.
Project was originally uploaded to Heroku, however, Heroku has shut down all free servers so it has been taken down
