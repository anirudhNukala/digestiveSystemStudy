<h2>The food is pushed to the stomach, where food is stored and protein digestion begins. The stomach secretes gastric juice, which, when mixed with food, forms a mixture called chyme. Gastric consists of hydrochloric acid (HCL), which makes gastric juice extremely acidic and able to denature proteins in the food. Gastric juice also consists of pepsin which breaks proteins into smaller polypeptides. The stomach secretes mucus and adds epithelial layers to protect against this acid.
